My Portfolio about projects

Project-1 :  Natas/AskIt

Synopsis:	

End users who required assistance to resolve their issues were needed to contact Service Desk. The SD agent needs to understand the user’s query and provide the solution. In case the agent could not provide an instant solution, a ticket was to be raised to address the issue. It was a manual process. The goal of this project was to implement a self-help application called NatAs such a way that the application interacts with the user in natural human language, understands the user’s query and provide the solution. The application was required to be built-in Natural Language Processing engine and a user friendly web interface to interact. Development team was required to develop the NatAs application (Business Logic and Database). User will be accessing/launching the NatAs application’s web interface from the existing intranet portals by clicking a hyperlink provided in it. 

Contribution:
	
Handled Middle layer and Database layer. Configuration of Python CORE ENGINE Module and Microsoft SQL Server,
MySQL, Created MS-SQL module for CURD operation. Analysing the work flow of NLP. Code Integration from MySQL to Microsoft SQL Server.
Database Migration from MySQL to MS-SQL. Customization of automated Data Population Script (RDF). 
Created batch script and Shale script to enable automated database backup. Code Debugging.
JSON Encoder to get data from NLP engine Performing WASA Testing, Fortify Scan for code,

Work Flow: In this proejct we are using "MontyLinua" lib for NLP. This lib can handel all text baesd processing logic, which usefull to develop a search engine based project. But this project is more about normal text based processing. It is about artical based processing logic. We have another layer to make this product as AI tool to perform more specific task in the tearm of (Machine Learning)

For Ex: In normal senario if you will search " How to Reset a password"
You will get all the artical which are similar to this text. But here after processing of "MontyLingua" for NLP, again we have develop our own NLP Lib which will classify the data based on artical.  

Project-2 : ERPNEXT

Synopsis:

ERPNext application was created to manage all business information in one application and use it to manage operations and take decisions based on data for example if you are running a small business that has a few employees, you understand that it's hard to manage the dynamic nature of doing businesses. You may are already be using a software like Accounting, and may be some more to manage your inventory and sales (or CRM). An ERP brings all of this together in one place. In this project we developed the application from scratch for managing resource planning for Real Estate Developer. This project was developed in Frappe Framework (a huge server side and client side framework). It has libraries and API for everything from authentication to reports, which develop Web application using Python and Maria DB. In ERPNEXT we have manage the all inventory related records. This module was aimed to handle the records related with PURCHASE INVOICE JOURNAL VOUCHER and SALES INVOICE.
