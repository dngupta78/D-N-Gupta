Work Flow: In this proejct we are using "MontyLinua" lib for NLP. This lib can handel all text baesd processing logic, which usefull to develop a search engine based project. But this project is more about normal text based processing. It is about artical based processing logic.

For Ex: In normal senario if you will search " How to Reset a password"
You will get all the artical which are similar to this text. But here after processing of "MontyLingua" for NLP, again we have develop out own NLP Lib which will classify the data based on artical.
